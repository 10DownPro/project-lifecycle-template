# Test Plan

**Purpose:**  
Define the scope, approach, & schedule of testing activities to validate deliverables meet requirements.

**When to Use:**  
Develop before the build phase is complete; execute during QA/UAT phases.

## Strategy
- Unit Tests: Verify individual components.
- Integration Tests: Ensure modules work together.
- End-to-End (E2E): Validate full workflows.
- Security Tests: Validate compliance & protection.

## Test Cases
- TC-01: [Description, Preconditions, Expected Results]
- TC-02: ...

## Entry/Exit Criteria
- Entry: Requirements finalized, code deployed to test env.
- Exit: All P1/P2 defects resolved, test cases passed.

## UAT
- Users: Identify test group.
- Scenarios: Real-world use cases.
- Sign-off: Document approvals.
