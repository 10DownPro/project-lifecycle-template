# 📋 Project Lifecycle Template

This is my go-to setup for running a project from kickoff to wrap-up without starting from scratch every time.  
If you’re new to project management (or just want more structure), this will walk you through what to track, when to track it, and how to keep everything organized in GitHub.

---

## 🎯 What This Is
It’s basically a **starter kit for PMs**.  
You’ll get:
- Templates for the most important project docs.
- Pre made GitHub labels to keep issues organized.
- Issue & PR templates so updates are consistent.
- A folder setup that keeps docs, plans, & deliverables separate.

## 📂 What’s Inside

| Folder/File | What it’s for |
|-------------|---------------|
| `/docs/` | All your main project docs – from the first idea to the post project wrap up. |
| `/planning/` | Where your roadmap & backlog live. |
| `/src/` | Space for your project’s actual work (code, configs, etc.). |
| `/.github/` | The “rules & tools” folder – issue templates, PR templates, workflows. |
| `.gitignore` | Keeps junk files out of your repo. |
| `LICENSE` | MIT license so others can use this without hassle. |

## 🗂 The Docs You’ll Use

**Inside `/docs/`, you’ve got:**
1. **Project Brief** – A quick, clear snapshot of the project’s purpose, goals, and scope.  
2. **Requirements** – What needs to happen and why.  
3. **Implementation Plan** – How you’re going to get it done.  
4. **Risk Register** – What could go wrong & how you’ll deal with it.  
5. **Test Plan** – How you’ll check that everything works.  
6. **Runbook** – The “how-to” guide for running & maintaining it.  
7. **Retrospective** – A look back at what worked and what didn’t.

Each template explains when to use it, so you’re not guessing.

## 💡 Why I Made This
When you’re starting out as a PM, it’s easy to lose track of what you should be documenting and when.  
This keeps me (and now you) from reinventing the wheel every project.  
It works whether you’re doing Agile, Waterfall, or a mix.
